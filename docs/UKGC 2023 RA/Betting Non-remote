# Betting (Non-Remote) - Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2023

**Overall Risk Rating:** High (Off-course) / Medium (On-course)

## Summary

Non-remote betting presents varying risk levels depending on location. Off-course betting shops are rated as high risk due to cash transactions, gaming machines, and accessibility to multiple premises. On-course betting at racecourses is rated as medium risk, with lower transaction volumes and different operational characteristics reducing some vulnerabilities.

## Case Examples

### Dyed Notes

Two individuals deposited several hundred pounds of bank notes into a self-service betting terminal which were later found to be stained with what appeared to be anti-theft dye. The individuals were then able to withdraw clean notes from counter staff.

### Lack of 'Closed Loop' System and Access to Multiple Premises

An individual deposited several thousand pounds on a self-service betting terminal using a debit card and made bets on several events. The bets were cashed out early before the events had started and the customer was able to withdraw the funds at a different store in the form of cash.

## Key Differences: Off-Course vs On-Course

### Off-Course (High Risk)

**Characteristics:**
- High street betting shops
- Greater accessibility and anonymity
- Gaming machines present
- Self-service betting terminals (SSBTs)
- Multiple premises accessible
- Higher transaction volumes

**Highest Risks:**
- Cash transactions (9)
- Unverified customers (9)
- Inadequate KYC (9)
- Accessibility to multiple premises (9)
- Lack of compliance (9)

### On-Course (Medium Risk)

**Characteristics:**
- Located at racecourses
- Limited operating times (race days only)
- Lower transaction volumes
- More transient customer base
- No gaming machines
- More regulated environment

**Key Risk Reductions:**
- Lower impact of employee collusion
- Reduced likelihood of unverified customers
- Less sophisticated money laundering operations
- Limited accessibility compared to high street

## Key Takeaways

- **Highest Risk Areas (Off-course):** Cash transactions, unverified customers, inadequate KYC, gaming machines, and TITO systems
- **Vulnerability Differences:** On-course betting generally poses lower risks due to operational constraints
- **Payment Concerns:** Dyed notes and Scottish notes pose risks in both environments
- **Gaming Machines:** Significant vulnerability unique to off-course operations
- **System Weaknesses:** Lack of closed loop systems enables cash-in/cashless-out schemes
- **Access Patterns:** Multiple premises accessibility in off-course sector facilitates structuring

## Regulatory Requirements

### Off-Course Operators Must:
- Implement robust KYC procedures at appropriate thresholds
- Monitor for patterns of transactions across multiple premises
- Implement effective controls for gaming machines and SSBTs
- Ensure closed loop systems where cashless payments accepted
- Train staff to identify and report suspicious cash transactions
- Monitor for dyed or Scottish notes
- Apply enhanced scrutiny to high-value or frequent customers
- Maintain effective customer interaction protocols

### On-Course Operators Must:
- Comply with all licensing requirements including ancillary licences for remote betting
- Implement appropriate KYC checks relative to risk level
- Monitor for suspicious betting patterns
- Train staff on basic AML/CTF indicators
- Report suspicious activity under POCA and TACT

### Both Must:
- Ensure competent key personnel with AML/CTF knowledge
- Conduct regular risk assessments
- Implement policies and procedures appropriate to their risk level
- Monitor third party business relationships
- Report suspicious activity appropriately
