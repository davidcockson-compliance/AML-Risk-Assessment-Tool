# Terrorist Financing - Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2023

**Overall Risk Rating:** Medium (across all gambling sectors)

**Previous Overall Risk Rating:** Low

## Summary

The terrorist financing risk assessment applies across all gambling sectors and has been upgraded from Low to Medium. While the likelihood of terrorist financing occurring remains Low, the impact assessment has increased from Low to High, reflecting the severe consequences of any successful terrorist financing activity. This assessment is partially based on the National Risk Assessment and close collaboration with UK counter-terrorism teams.

## Change in Risk Assessment

## Conclusion

The upgrade of terrorist financing risk from Low to Medium reflects a more nuanced understanding of the potential consequences rather than an increase in likelihood. While terrorist financing through gambling remains unlikely, the severe impact of any successful TF activity justifies heightened vigilance and enhanced controls.

Operators across all gambling sectors must ensure they understand TF-specific risks, implement appropriate controls, and maintain awareness of evolving terrorist financing typologies. The low likelihood should not lead to complacency—the high impact demands proportionate attention and effective risk mitigation.

This assessment should be read alongside sector-specific ML risk assessments, as many vulnerabilities can be exploited for both ML and TF purposes, though the indicators and investigation processes may differ.
