# Casino (Non-Remote) - Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2023

**Overall Risk Rating:** High

## Summary

Non-remote (land-based) casinos present high risk for money laundering and terrorist financing. Key vulnerabilities include cash transactions, employee collusion, and Money Service Business (MSB) activities. The physical presence of customers offers some mitigation compared to remote operations, but significant risks remain.

## Case Example

### Scottish Notes

An individual attempted to exchange a large quantity of Scottish notes at a casino cash desk and their request was denied. They were later seen on the casino's CCTV inserting large quantities of cash into an electronic gaming machine. The machine was later checked and found to contain several thousand pounds in Scottish notes.

## Money Service Business (MSB) Activities

### Prevalence
- Approximately 66% of non-remote casinos offered some form of MSB activity during the reporting period
- MSB activities include foreign exchange, third-party money transmission, and third-party cheque cashing
- The Gambling Commission acts as the supervisory authority for MSB activities carried out by casinos

### Specific MSB Risks

| Risk Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Foreign exchange | Criminals use casinos to exchange illicit cash for different currencies, obscuring the audit trail |
| Third-party money transmission | Criminals send money through casinos to avoid detection by financial institutions |
| Third-party cheque cashing | Casinos cash cheques for individuals who may not have obtained them legitimately |

### Red Flag Indicators for MSB Activity

- Customers who regularly use MSB services but engage in minimal or no gambling
- Large or frequent foreign exchange transactions with no clear gambling purpose
- Customers who receive funds via money transmission services but don't gamble with them
- Requests to cash cheques for amounts significantly higher than typical gambling activity
- Customers attempting to structure MSB transactions to avoid detection thresholds
- Use of MSB services followed immediately by withdrawal of funds in different form

### MSB Control Challenges

Commission research found:
- Approximately 87% of non-remote casinos were unaware of their obligations as MSB providers
- Around 89% of casinos did not have adequate policies and procedures relating to MSB activity
- Some casinos were unable to separate their financial data accurately in relation to MSB activity

## Key Takeaways

- **Highest Risk Areas:** Cash transactions, employee collusion, MSB activities, smurfing, and inadequate due diligence all rated as High (9)
- **Emerging Concerns:** Unlicensed employees conducting ID checks, lack of regulatory compliance personnel
- **MSB Vulnerabilities:** Significant knowledge gaps among operators regarding MSB obligations
- **Employee Threats:** Internal collusion and unlicensed staff present substantial vulnerabilities
- **Increasing Trends:** Smurfing has increased in likelihood

## Regulatory Requirements

Non-remote casinos must:
- Comply with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017
- Maintain a properly empowered Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO)
- Ensure all personnel conducting ID checks hold personal licences
- Implement adequate policies for MSB activities where offered
- Separate financial data for MSB activities from gambling activities
- Conduct enhanced due diligence on high-risk customers
- Monitor and report suspicious cash transactions
- Implement effective controls against smurfing
- Conduct thorough background checks on all employees
