# Casino (Remote) - Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2023

**Overall Risk Rating:** High

## Summary

Remote casinos present high risk for money laundering and terrorist financing due to factors including the lack of physical customer presence, high monetary thresholds, and the use of multiple payment methods. The sector faces significant vulnerabilities across operator controls, customer verification, and payment mechanisms.

## Case Examples

### Pre-paid Cards

**Example 1:** An individual made large deposits using pre-paid cards. When the operator attempted to determine the source of the individual's funds, the customer claimed that they received their salary in cash.

**Example 2:** An individual deposited several thousand pounds with pre-paid cards. Subsequent checks revealed that they were unemployed.

### Smurfing

An individual had several failed deposit attempts and then made a series of deposits in low amounts. Once the deposits had been made, the customer requested an immediate withdrawal without any gameplay and then made a further small deposit.

## Key Takeaways

- **Highest Risk Areas:** Pre-paid cards, white label providers, mule accounts, smurfing, lack of physical customer presence, and MSB activities all rated as High (9)
- **Emerging Risks:** Third party business relationships, lack of personnel competence, and MSB operations are newly identified high-risk areas
- **Payment Method Concerns:** Multiple payment methods and crypto assets present significant laundering opportunities
- **Customer Identification:** Remote nature of operations creates fundamental challenges in customer verification

## Regulatory Requirements

Operators must:
- Implement effective policies, procedures and controls under Licence Condition 12.1.1
- Conduct robust customer due diligence (CDD)
- Implement closed loop systems where appropriate
- Monitor high-value customer schemes carefully
- Ensure competent key personnel with appropriate AML/CTF knowledge
- Apply enhanced scrutiny to customers from high-risk jurisdictions
- Report suspicious activity appropriately under POCA and TACT
