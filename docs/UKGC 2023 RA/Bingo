# Bingo (Remote & Non-Remote) - Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment 2023

**Overall Risk Rating:** High (Remote) / Medium (Non-Remote)

## Summary

Bingo operations present different risk levels depending on delivery method. Remote bingo is rated as high risk due to challenges with customer verification, multiple account accessibility, and payment method vulnerabilities. Non-remote (land-based) bingo halls are rated as medium risk, with physical customer presence and lower transaction limits providing some mitigation.

## Case Examples

### False or Stolen ID (Remote Bingo)

A criminal used stolen ID and debit cards with a gambling operator. The individual deposited funds from several stolen debit cards into the gambling account and then attempted to withdraw the funds to one debit card.

### Multiple Methods of Payment (Remote Bingo)

**Example 1:** An individual made deposits into their gambling account from several different debit cards as well as an e-wallet. When withdrawing funds, they only used the e-wallet.

**Example 2:** A customer made multiple deposits using numerous debit cards within the first hour of opening their account.

### Accessibility to Multiple Accounts (Remote Bingo)

Following Know Your Customer (KYC) checks an individual was identified as having deposits and credits with several dozen online gambling operators and payment processors during only a few months.

### Scottish Notes (Non-Remote Bingo)

A customer attempted to exchange a large amount of Scottish notes for English notes at the cash desk but was unable to explain the origin of the funds when asked.

## Emerging Risks and Trends

### Remote Bingo
- **Third party agents:** Increased use of agents to obscure source and ownership of funds
- **Smurfing patterns:** Multiple small deposits to avoid detection thresholds
- **Cryptoassets:** Growing concern as payment method
- **Multiple accounts:** Despite decrease in likelihood, remains significant concern

### Non-Remote Bingo
- **TITO systems:** When combined with ATR machines, create laundering opportunities
- **Scottish notes:** Emerging concern for cash verification
- **BYOD systems:** New technology introducing new vulnerabilities

## Key Takeaways

### Remote Bingo

- **Payment Vulnerabilities:** Multiple methods, cryptoassets, and pre-paid cards all present significant risks
- **Customer Risks:** Third party agents and smurfing are emerging concerns

### Non-Remote Bingo
- **Overall Lower Risk:** Physical presence and operational controls reduce risk to medium
- **Cash Concerns:** Cash payments and TITO systems present main vulnerabilities
