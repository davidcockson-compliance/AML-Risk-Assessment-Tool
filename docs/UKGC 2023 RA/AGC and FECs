**Overall Risk Rating:** Medium (AGCs) / Low (FECs)

## Summary

Adult Gaming Centres and Family Entertainment Centres present different risk profiles. AGCs are rated as medium risk due to higher-stake gaming machines, cash transactions, and anonymous customer access. FECs are rated as low risk due to lower stake limits, family-oriented environments, and reduced criminal appeal.
